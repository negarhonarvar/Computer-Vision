    <th>Applying diffrent filters on diffrent images and observing how each filter can exploit diffrent features of an image. Furthermore , how the appliance of filters on images prior to inputing them to a CNN model can enhance the precision of the result.</th>

    <th> Counting Number of stars in the sky from a noisy image. for succeeding in this task we had to reduce the white noises and count the significant remaining white dots as stars. </th>

    <th>A pseudo-regular RSRG graph is constructed and the plots for degree distribution, eigenvalue distribution and Also, the parameters of spectral gap, natural connectivity, symmetry ratio, energy and Laplacian energy  is drawn.Next we Choose one from the set of p values in each step and Calculate values for that and run 100 to 1000 times . then we calculated average algebraic connection by Monte Carlo simulation and plot the probability density distribution for the allowed values of d .</th>
