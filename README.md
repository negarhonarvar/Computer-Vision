    <th>Applying diffrent filters on diffrent images and observing how each filter can exploit diffrent features of an image. Furthermore , how the appliance of filters on images prior to inputing them to a CNN model can enhance the precision of the result.</th>

    <th> Counting Number of stars in the sky from a noisy image. for succeeding in this task we had to reduce the white noises and count the significant remaining white dots as stars. </th>

    <th>Histograms of a number of images are plotted, then slidded to left and right which resulted in new histograms. for each slidded histogram its corresponding image is visualized which is practical for comparison between diffrent histograms.</th>
